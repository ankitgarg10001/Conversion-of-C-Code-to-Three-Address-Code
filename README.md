Conversion-of-C-Code-to-Three-Address-Code (Sem 6)
==========================================

Code generation is the process by which a compiler’s code generator converts some intermediate representation of source code into a form (e.g., machine code) that can be readily executed by a machine.
So we are aiming to create a program that converts a “C Code” to a “Three Address code”
Our target is to achieve the Three address code using:-
1) Lexical Analyzer -: its main job is to break up an input stream into more usable elements or in, other words, to identify the "interesting bits" in a text file. It is use to generate tokens for the input file.
2) Syntax Directed Translation -: the translation of languages guided by context free grammars. Values of the attributes are computed by “semantic rules” associated with grammar productions.
